(i) Make sure that you understand the formal statement (see Chapter 4).
(ii) Compare different versions of the theorem; does each imply the other?
is one version more general?
(iii) Try to prove the theorem yourself without reading any given proof.
(iv) Make sure that you understand the given proof line-by-line, i.e. you
understand the meaning of each statement, and why it follows from the
previous statements.
(v) Identify where in the proof each assumption is used.
(vi) Identify the crucial ideas in the proof (mark them in the margin of your
lecture notes, or note them on a separate sheet; this will be useful for
revision).
(vii) Try omitting one of the assumptions; does the conclusion of the theorem
still hold? can you find an example to show that it does not?
(viii) Try the statement of the theorem and the proof on some special cases
to get a feeling for what it means.
