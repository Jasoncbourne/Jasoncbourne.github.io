(i) Make sure that you understand the formal statement. <br/>
(ii) Compare different versions of the theorem; does each imply the other?
is one version more general? <br/>
(iii) Try to prove the theorem yourself without reading any given proof. <br/>
(iv) Make sure that you understand the given proof line-by-line, i.e. you
understand the meaning of each statement, and why it follows from the
previous statements. <br/>
(v) Identify where in the proof each assumption is used. <br/>
要明白在证明的过程中，在哪些地方用到了条件的假设。<br/>
(vi) Identify the crucial ideas in the proof (mark them in the margin of your
lecture notes, or note them on a separate sheet; this will be useful for
revision). <br/>
在定理的证明中，一定要知道其中最主要的思想。这种思想能让我们更好的了解定理。<br/>
(vii) Try omitting one of the assumptions; does the conclusion of the theorem
still hold? can you find an example to show that it does not? <br/>
如果一个假设丢了，定理是否成立？<br/>
(viii) Try the statement of the theorem and the proof on some special cases
to get a feeling for what it means.
